# osd-annotation - Annotation tools for Openseadragon built with Paper.js

This project combines the [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) zoomable image viewer with [PaperJS](http://paperjs.org/)-based annotations drawn into a synced zoomable overlay.

## Demo pages:
View and annotate slides from any [Digital Slide Archive instance](https://pearcetm.github.io/osd-paperjs-annotation/demo/dsa/app.html). Enter the base URL for the DSA in the box and press the "Open DSA" button. Some archives may have publically available slides to view, but to save changes you will need to be logged in.

## To do

- BlankCanvasTileSource for OpenSeadragon
-- Allow an empty/blank image to be used as a drawing background, rather than an actual image
